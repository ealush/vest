/**
 * Enforce is quite complicated, I want to explain it in detail.
 * It is dynamic in nature, so a lot of proxy objects are involved.
 *
 * Enforce has two main interfaces
 * 1. eager
 * 2. lazy
 *
 * The eager interface is the most commonly used, and the easier to understand.
 * It throws an error when a rule is not satisfied.
 * The eager interface is declared in enforceEager.ts and it is quite simple to understand.
 * enforce is called with a value, and the return value is a proxy object that points back to all the rules.
 * When a rule is called, the value is mapped as its first argument, and if the rule passes, the same
 * proxy object is returned. Otherwise, an error is thrown.
 *
 * The lazy interface works quite differently. It is declared in genEnforceLazy.ts.
 * Rather than calling enforce directly, the lazy interface has all the rules as "methods" (only by proxy).
 * Calling the first function in the chain will initialize an array of calls. It stores the different rule calls
 * and the parameters passed to them. None of the rules are called yet.
 * The rules are only invoked in sequence once either of these chained functions are called:
 * 1. test(value)
 * 2. run(value)
 *
 * Calling run or test will call all the rules in sequence, with the difference that test will only return a boolean value,
 * while run will return an object with the validation result and an optional message created by the rule.
