# Enforce

For assertions, Vest is bundled with [Enforce](https://npmjs.com/package/n4s). Enforce is a validation assertion library. It allows you to run your data against rules and conditions and test whether it passes your validations. It is intended for validation logic that gets repeated over and over again and should not be written manually. It comes with a wide variety of pre-built rules, but it can also be extended to support your own repeated custom logic.

The way Enforce operates is similar to most common assertion libraries. You pass it a value, and one or more rules to test your value against - if the validation fails, it throws an Error, otherwise - it will move on to the next rule in the chain.

```js
import { enforce } from 'vest';

enforce(4).isNumber();
// passes

enforce(4).isNumber().greaterThan(2);
// passes

enforce(4)
  .lessThan(2) // throws an error, will not carry on to the next rule
  .greaterThan(3);
```

Enforce exposes all predefined and custom rules. You may use chaining to make multiple enfocements for the same value.

# Business Related Rules

Along with the existing rules, you might need different business related rules, for email, phone number, credit card validations, and more.

Enforce uses [validator.js](https://github.com/validatorjs/validator.js) to provide some of these validations.

## Validator.js validations currently provided:

- isAlphanumeric
- isCreditCard
- isCurrency
- isEmail
- isIP
- isIdentityCard
- isJSON
- isLocale
- isMimeType
- isMobilePhone
- isPassportNumber
- isPostalCode
- isURL

Because these rules are business specific, and can have an impact on your bundle size, they are split into a their own bundle.

For example:

```js
import enforce from 'vest/enforceExtended';

enforce('example@gmail.com').isEmail();
```

Some of these rules also require locale arrays and objects. These are also exported by the extended entry point:

```js
import enforce, {
  isAlphanumericLocales,
  isMobilePhoneLocales,
  isPostalCodeLocales,
} from 'vest/enforceExtended';
```
