title: Vest's Suite
description: All your validations reside in a Vest suite. The suite is a function that retains a javascript closure with the current validation state, and it returns the result object. It also exposes some methods to interact with the data, reset the state and handle async validations.

# Vest's Suite: Writing Your Validation Suite

A Vest suite is the container for all your validations, where you can define and organize them. In this article, we will explain how to create a Vest suite and perform various operations on it.

## Basic Suite Structure

You can create a Vest suite using the `create` function provided by the `Vest` module. Here's a basic example:

```js
import { create } from 'vest';

const suite = create((data = {}) => {
  // ... Your validations go here
});
```

You pass a callback function to the `create` function, which takes the form data as its first argument, and any other arguments you might want to pass. You can then define your validations inside this function.

## Running the Suite

You can run your suite by calling it with the form data and any additional arguments you want to pass:

```js
const suite = create((data = {}, currentField) => {
  // ... Your validations go here
});

suite(formData, fieldName);
```

You can pass as many arguments as you need to the suite function, and they will be available inside the callback function.

## Getting the Current Suite State

There are two main ways of getting the current state of our suite:

### Using the Result Object

When you run the suite, it returns a result object that contains the validation state:

```js
const result = suite(formData, fieldName);

result.hasErrors(); // boolean
```

The result object is similar to the one you define in your suite function, except that it does not have the `done` property that allows you to set callbacks for async validations.

### Using `suite.get()`

You can also get the current state of your suite by calling `suite.get()` at any time, even within the suite itself. This method returns the current validation state, which may be partial if called within a running suite.

This method is especially useful if we want to access our suite state from within a running suite, or when out of context - for example, from a different UI component than our form.

## Cleaning up the Suite State

If you need to clean up the validation state of your suite, you can call `suite.reset()`. This will reset the state of the suite and cancel any pending async validations that might still be running.

## Resetting a Single Field

To reset the validity of a single field, you can call `suite.resetField(fieldName)`. This can be useful, for example, when you only want to run the validation on blur.

## Removing a Single Field from the Suite State

In some cases, you may want to remove a field from the suite state. For example, when the user removes a dynamically added field. In this case, you can call `suite.remove(fieldName)` to remove the field from the state and cancel any pending async validations that might still be running.

Note that you don't need to use `suite.remove` very often, as most users can simply use `reset` and `omitWhen`.

## Subscribing to Suite State Changes

You can subscribe to changes in the suite state by calling `suite.subscribe(callback)`. The callback will be called whenever the suite state changes internally.

```js
suite.subscribe(() => {
  const result = suite.get();
  // ... Do something with the result
});
```

### Unsubscribing from Suite State Changes

The `subscribe` method returns a function that you can call to unsubscribe from the suite state changes:

```js
const unsubscribe = suite.subscribe();
```
